/**
 * SplitExecutor — orchestrates multi-recipient split payment execution (Issue #591).
 *
 * Runs a subentry capacity pre-flight check via {@link checkSubentryCapacity}
 * for each recipient account before attempting to add new trustlines or data
 * entries, preventing silent `op_low_reserve` failures on the Stellar network.
 *
 * Callers may opt out of the capacity check by passing
 * `{ skipCapacityCheck: true }` in the options, which bypasses the guard
 * entirely without altering any other pre-flight behaviour.
 *
 * Issue #778 — when recipients declare a `ratio`, the executor first verifies
 * that the ratios sum to exactly 1.0 (within {@link SPLIT_RATIO_TOLERANCE})
 * and throws {@link SplitRatioSumError} otherwise, so floating-point rounding
 * errors or user input mistakes can never silently over- or underpay a split.
 * Splits without ratios behave exactly as before.
